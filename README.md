# Find Stacking Contexts

This is an algorithm based off the [MDN stacking context documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context#The_stacking_context) to find all the parent stacking contexts of a given element.

The idea of this package is to make it easier to debug why your z-index may not be applied as you might expect it to.
